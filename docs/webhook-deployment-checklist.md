# Webhook Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

### Core Webhook Functionality
- [x] **Retell AI Compatible Payloads** - Supports all official Retell webhook events
- [x] **HMAC Signature Verification** - Proper security using Retell API key
- [x] **Outbound Call Processing** - Handles campaign call webhooks (started, ended, analyzed)
- [x] **Inbound Call Processing** - Processes inbound calls with user notifications
- [x] **Database Integration** - Updates all relevant tables (`calls`, `call_campaigns`, etc.)
- [x] **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error catching and logging
- [x] **CORS Support** - Handles preflight and cross-origin requests

### Event Processing
- [x] **Call Started** - Creates call records, links to campaigns, updates contact status
- [x] **Call Ended** - Records duration, cost, disconnect reasons, updates statistics  
- [x] **Call Analyzed** - Stores transcripts, AI analysis, sentiment data
- [x] **Inbound Calls** - Creates notifications for organization users

### Security & Reliability
- [x] **Signature Verification** - Using `verifyRetellWebhookSignature()` function
- [x] **Environment Variables** - Secure API key storage
- [x] **Database Error Handling** - Graceful failure handling
- [x] **Request Validation** - Proper payload structure validation

### Testing & Documentation
- [x] **Test Scripts** - Both bash and TypeScript webhook testers
- [x] **Documentation** - Complete implementation guide
- [x] **Error Scenarios** - Invalid signature testing
- [x] **Build Verification** - TypeScript compilation successful

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Set in Supabase project settings or .env
RETELL_API_KEY=your_retell_api_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 2. Deploy Edge Function
```bash
# Deploy the webhook function
supabase functions deploy retell-webhook

# Set environment variables
supabase secrets set RETELL_API_KEY=your_retell_api_key_here
```

### 3. Configure Retell AI
Set webhook URL in Retell AI dashboard:
```
https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/retell-webhook
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Test with the provided script
./scripts/test-webhook-simple.sh -k your-real-api-key all
```

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Outbound Campaign Calls
1. **Call Started**: Creates call record, links to campaign, marks contact as "calling"
2. **Call Ended**: Updates status, records cost/duration, increments campaign processed count  
3. **Call Analyzed**: Stores transcript and AI analysis, updates success metrics

### Inbound Calls
1. **Call Inbound**: Creates notification for all organization users
2. **Activity Logged**: Records inbound call event for audit trail
3. **Agent Assignment**: Uses configured inbound agent or webhook-provided agent

### Database Updates
- `calls` table: Complete call records with timing, cost, analysis
- `call_campaigns` table: Updated processed counts and timestamps
- `campaign_contacts` table: Individual contact status and outcomes  
- `notifications` table: User notifications for inbound calls
- `activity_logs` table: System event audit trail

## üîç Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Track
- Webhook response times (< 10 seconds required)
- Signature verification success rate (should be ~100%)
- Database operation success rate
- Notification delivery rate for inbound calls

### Alert Conditions
- High number of 401 Unauthorized responses (potential security issue)
- Database update failures (data consistency problems)
- Webhook processing times approaching 10s timeout
- Missing environment variables

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**401 Unauthorized Errors**
- Verify `RETELL_API_KEY` environment variable is set
- Check API key has webhook permissions in Retell dashboard
- Ensure signature generation matches HMAC-SHA256 format

**Database Errors**  
- Verify all referenced tables exist (`calls`, `call_campaigns`, etc.)
- Check RLS policies allow service role access
- Ensure foreign key relationships are properly configured

**Missing Notifications**
- Check phone number is properly associated with organization
- Verify user profiles exist in organization
- Review notification table constraints and permissions

**Call/Campaign Association Issues**
- Ensure agents have proper `retell_agent_id` mapping
- Check campaign status is "processing" for active campaigns
- Verify agent-to-organization relationships

## üö® Production Readiness

### Security Checklist
- [x] Webhook signature verification implemented
- [x] Environment variables secured (not in code)
- [x] CORS configured appropriately
- [x] Error messages don't expose sensitive data
- [x] Database access uses service role securely

### Performance Checklist  
- [x] Database operations are optimized (single queries where possible)
- [x] Error handling prevents webhook timeouts
- [x] Logging is comprehensive but not excessive
- [x] Function handles concurrent requests properly

### Operational Checklist
- [x] Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- [x] Health check endpoint (responds to OPTIONS)
- [x] Test scripts for validation
- [x] Documentation for maintenance

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Email/SMS Notifications** - Extend inbound call notifications beyond database records
2. **Retry Mechanism** - Add exponential backoff for failed database operations  
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Aggregate campaign performance metrics
4. **Webhook Event Queuing** - Handle high-volume webhook bursts

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Real-time Dashboard** - Live webhook event monitoring
2. **Automated Campaign Actions** - Trigger follow-ups based on call outcomes
3. **Multi-tenant Isolation** - Enhanced security for organization data
4. **Webhook Event Replay** - Recovery mechanism for failed processing
